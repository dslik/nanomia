Assembled and tested the new front panel that uses a PCB diffusor for the LEDs instead of 8x8 LED matrix modules. It looks gorgeous. This exceeded my expectations.

Here are the PCBs so far:

From left to right:
- Front panel
- LED spacer
- LED board
- Analog board

Not shown:
- Control/Power board (design not yet finished)

I was pleasantly surprised not to be hit with an extra manufacturing charge for the LED spacer, with it's 256 holes.

For reference, here's what the earlier prototype version of this module looked like:
