![Video of two Levels Eurorack modules](./images/levels.mov)

House wiring conventions are white for CV, pink for gate, and blue for audio.

## Project Overview
The Nanomia Levels module provides a peak programme meter (PPM) that can be used for audio, CV and gate monitoring. Two seperate channels (typically right and left) can be monitored, with two buffered outputs for loop through.

While these modules can be hand-assembled, they are best ordered pre-assembled from your PCB house. BOM and component placement files are provided for the LED board (2432-0301) and the main processor board (2432-0401).

Full assembly instructions will be uploaded soon.
