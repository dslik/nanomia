# Nanomia Dual Adjustible CV Output

## Project Overview
The Nanomia Outs Quad module provides two CV level outputs, each with a fine and coarse slider. Outputs can be configured to be between 0 - 5V, 0 - 12V or -12 - 12V using configuration switches. SMT resistors can be replaced for other ranges.

This module uses two 2411-0201 PCBs.

So this project is finished!

The switches I'm using are currently out of stock, and when I can figure out how to order less than a full reel, I will get 25 or so built to keep in stock.
